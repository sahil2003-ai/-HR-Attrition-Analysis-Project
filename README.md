# -HR-Attrition-Analysis-Project

📌 Project Overview

Employee attrition (or turnover) is one of the most critical HR challenges for organizations.
In this project, I analyzed an HR dataset using Excel, SQL, Power BI, and Python to identify key drivers of employee attrition and provide actionable business insights.

The project covers the end-to-end data analysis lifecycle:

Data Cleaning & Exploration

SQL-based Analysis

Interactive Power BI Dashboard

Python-based Analysis & Visualization

🗂️ Files in this Repository

HR_Attrition_Analysis.csv → Raw dataset

HR Attrition analysis.xlsx → Excel cleaning, pivot tables & charts

HR_Attrition_Analysis.sql → SQL queries for attrition insights

HR Attrition Analysis Dashboard.pbix → Power BI dashboard

HR_Attrition_Professional_Analysis.ipynb → Python notebook for extended analysis

🔧 Tools & Skills Used

Excel: Data cleaning, pivot tables, KPI analysis

SQL: Aggregations, grouping, attrition % calculation, role/department-based insights

Power BI: Dashboard creation, KPIs, data visualization

Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn): Data wrangling & advanced analytics

📈 Key Analysis & Insights

Overall Attrition Rate calculated using SQL queries

Attrition by Department – Sales department showed higher turnover

Attrition by Job Role – Certain roles faced significantly higher attrition

Salary & Attrition – Employees with lower salaries had higher attrition rates

Overtime Impact – Attrition was strongly correlated with overtime work

Age Group Analysis – Younger employees (<25) showed higher turnover
